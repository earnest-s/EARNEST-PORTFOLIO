# EARNEST-PORTFOLIO

## Portfolio Overview

**EARNEST-PORTFOLIO** is a Node.js–based web application serving as a professional portfolio site. Its purpose is to showcase the creator’s web development and academic projects online. An online portfolio is generally “a website you create to show off your skills, experience, projects”, which is exactly what this project does. Under the hood, this app runs on **Node.js**, the free, open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime for building web servers and apps. The project likely uses a Node-based web framework (such as Express) to serve pages dynamically and manage routing.

## Features

* **Project Showcase:** Each web development or academic project has its own page or section with descriptions and links to demos or code. (Standard portfolio practice is to highlight projects with context and visuals.)
* **Responsive Design:** The site is fully responsive, ensuring it works well on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. Modern portfolios should adapt to all screen sizes.
* **Downloadable Resume:** A link or button allows visitors to download a PDF resume. Providing a “downloadable resume” and clear calls-to-action (e.g. “Hire Me” or resume link) is a common portfolio feature.
* **Contact/Call-to-Action:** The site includes easy-to-find contact information or a contact form so that potential employers or clients can reach out. It’s important to make contact info visible and accessible. (Often there is a “Contact Me” form or email link.)
* **Clean UI:** The interface uses modern HTML/CSS styling (possibly a CSS framework or custom styles) and intuitive navigation. The focus is on clear communication and usability rather than flashy animations.

## Technologies Used

This project is built with a typical Node.js/Express web stack:

* **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime for building the server-side of the app.
* **Express.js:** A minimal, fast Node.js web application framework for handling routing and HTTP requests.
* **Templating Engine:** (Likely something like Handlebars or EJS.) These engines render dynamic HTML pages on the server. For example, many Node portfolios use **Express-Handlebars** or **EJS** for templates.
* **HTML5 & CSS3 (Sass):** Standard web markup and styling languages. The project may use **Sass** (a CSS preprocessor) for organized stylesheets, and modern layout techniques (Flexbox/Grid).
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Client-side scripts for interactivity and dynamic behaviors.
* **npm (Node Package Manager):** To install and manage project dependencies.
* **Development Tools:** (Often a tool like **nodemon** is used for auto-reloading during development.)

These technologies (Node.js with Express, plus a templating engine and CSS preprocessor) form the foundation of many developer portfolios.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Install Node.js:** Ensure you have Node.js (LTS version) installed on your system. You can download the LTS installer from the [official Node.js site](https://nodejs.org).
2. **Clone the Repository:** In your terminal, run:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/snipergib/EARNEST-PORTFOLIO.git
   cd EARNEST-PORTFOLIO
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies:** Inside the project folder, install required packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Run the App:** Start the application (often using a dev script or simply `npm start`):

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

   This will launch the server locally (e.g. on `http://localhost:3000`). The above steps (clone, `npm install`, `npm run dev` or `node server.js`) follow standard Node.js setup instructions.

## Deployment / Hosting Guidelines

The app can be deployed to any Node.js–compatible hosting environment. Typical approaches include using services like **Heroku**, **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**, **DigitalOcean App Platform**, or similar platforms that support Node.js. You will generally need to set up a hosting account and (optionally) a custom domain name for the portfolio – for example, using providers like Bluehost, Kinsta, or Netlify (with serverless functions). In deployment, ensure environment variables (if any) and the `start` script in `package.json` are configured. In short, deploy it like any web app: push the code to a server with Node.js installed, install dependencies, and run the start script. (Refer to Node.js deployment guides for details.)

## Folder Structure (Project Architecture)

The project follows a common Node/Express layout. For example, one can expect:

* `app.js` (or `server.js`): Main application entry point (sets up Express, middleware, and routes).
* `package.json`: Project metadata and dependency list.
* `public/`: Static assets (CSS, JavaScript, images) served to the browser.
* `routes/`: Express route handler files (defines how URLs map to code).
* `views/`: Template files (e.g. `.hbs` or `.ejs` files) for rendering HTML.
* (Optionally `helpers/`, `config/`, or others for organization.)

This mirrors typical Express project structures. For example, similar portfolios include folders like `public/`, `views/`, and `routes/` along with the main `app.js`.
